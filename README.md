# esp32cam local proxy
Makes it possible to open esp32 cam stream in multiple devices/browsers.
Controll buttons still work global way as there is one camera stream and image resolution set globally.

## Current Functionalities

* hardcoded local ip/port way of reaching camera and this proxy

* global image size control

## TODO

* Add configurable one place or dynamic render for IP adresses/port, currently hardcoded CAM and proxy URL
